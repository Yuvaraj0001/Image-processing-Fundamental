# Image processing

## What is image?

An `image` is a spatial representation of two dimensional or three dimensional scene.

An `image` is a array or matrix of pixels (`picture elememts`) arranged in rowa and columns.

1. A digital image is composed M rows and N columns of pixels each storing a value.
2. Pixels values are most often gray levels in the range of 0-255  (Black-White).

## Why digital image processing?

There are two principle application areas in digital image processing,
* Improvement of pictorial information for human interpretation.
* Processing of image data for storage, transmission and representation for autonomous machine perception

## Types of image?

### 1. Color image

Every image on your computer screen is displayed using the `three colors red, blue and green`. By mixing these three colors in various amounts your computer can create the other colors in the spectrum.

### 2. Gray scale image

A `gray scale image` is a digital image in which each pixel only contains one scalar value which is its intensity. For example, an image encoded with n=8 bits will only have L=2^8=256 possible intensity values going from `0 representing black` to `255 representing white`.

### 3. Binary image

The binary image contain only two pixel values 0 and 1. Here `0 refers to black` color and `1 refers to white color`. It is also known as `Monochrome`.

## Various image formats

These are the general image formats used widely.

1. TIFF(.tif, .tiff) - Tagged Image File Format
2. JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - Joint Photographic Experts Group
3. PNG (.png) - Portable Network Graphics 
4. Bitmap (.bmp) - Bit Map Image
5. GIF (.gif) - Graphics Interchange Format
